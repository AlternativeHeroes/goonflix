//By default production code should be in src/main/java
//Test code should be in src/test/java
//Resources to put in the jar should be in src/main/resources
//This gives you a lot of tasks predefined for java, but the most important is build
//build will compile the code, run the tests, and make the jar file.
//also used a lot is clean, which will delete all the files made by build
//also available is assemble which will compile the code but not run the test
//also available is check which will compile and run the tests
